# Using Game Tracker

## What is this app for?
This app is designed for users to quickly check on games they are interested in buying.\
By following a game, it's added to your dashboard, allowing you to check the price in \
numerous online stores where it is sold.\
Below is an example of a users dashboard after a few games have been added.

And here is an example of the display when viewing a game you're following. \
All of the available places to buy the game will be listed below the title card.

Use the search bar beneath the header to look for games to follow. Just a tip, \
you must be following a game to set a price alert!

While this app does not handle purchasing of games (we link you to sites instead), \
we still value security, therefore all passwords are hashed before they're saved.
